Write a concise, informative pull request title:

* It should be a very short summary in imperative mood
* Explain the 'why' behind changes more so than the changes
* Keep the title under 50 characters
* If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string

Think carefully before you write your title.

What you write will be passed to create the title of a github pull request
